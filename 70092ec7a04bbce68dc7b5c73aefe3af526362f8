      "message": "LabelTypes has a parameterless protected constructor.\n\nGuice correctly :-( picks that constructor to generate the injected instance.\n\nAlthough that constructor looks unused, it is nevertheless required by GWT in the generated file\n\n gerrit-gwtui/target/.generated/com/google/gerrit/common/data/LabelTypes_JsonSerializer.java\n\n. So we cannot simply remove that constructor.\n\nThis leaves us with an unwanted (and uninitialized) injection for LabelTypes. But I guess this is only an issue for legacy code.\n\nAs I5135b3f47e71d04c9231cd078e4058dbb43c7e86 has been merged already, gerrit should be clean of injecting LabelTypes.",

      "message": "Good point. Once again I\u0027m bitten by the fact that protected \u003e default visibility. I believe you that we\u0027ve gotten rid of all current JIT injections of LabelTypes but I\u0027d feel safer if there were some way to fix it. But if gwtui *requires* a protected no-arg constructor...not sure what we can do. I guess if we create our own LabelTypes_JsonSerializer we might be able to work around it but that seems like more effort than it\u0027s worth.",
